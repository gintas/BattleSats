Battle Sats

Battle Sats is a game for the Android platform.

The game requires Android 2.1 (API level 7) to run.  It should run on pretty
much any hardware, even the older models.

Swipe the screen to launch a satellite. The longer the swipe, the higher
the initial velocity. Pinch to zoom in/out.

Battle Sats is written in Java (using Eclipse).  It uses some bits from the
Lunar Lander sample included with the Android SDK.  It is available under
the New BSD licence. Feel free to look around the source code.
